# Running Affair - Introduction

He is panting.
Gasping for air.
His muscles are burning.
His chest begins to hurt.
He can see the 5K finish line right ahead of him.

But he is not quite there yet.

"One more minute" - He said to himself, glancing quickly at the timer watch on his left wrist.
Twenty eight minutes, and fifty five seconds.

He has never run this fast.
Completing a 5K race is common enough for him. 
But a sub-thirty 5K, is surely a record.
This is his first time attempting to complete the 5K run in under thirty minutes.

Running slowly would feel like walking to untrained individuals, dull and not so stressful.
He has always thought when the burning sensation in his legs, his calves, and even his chest went away, he would feel better.
But he craves it, the burning, the panting, the heart firing rapidly inside his chest.
He realize that lower intensity run cannot offer what he seeks.
So faster he goes, he pursuits speed as a mean, to burn.
No sweat, no victory.
