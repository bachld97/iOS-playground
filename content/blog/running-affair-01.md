# Running Affair

## Chapter 1 - Fresh meet
"It's hot in here, must be Summer" - he greeted me with a silly line from a famous sitcom "The Big Bang Theory". 

"I'm Eric, I was impressed by your performance last Sunday. Pleased to meet you".

I laughed weakly at the boy. I recognized him. I usually spotted him when I went for my training session on Tuesdays and Thursday. Fellow runner.

However, I had no idea  what he was talking about. I had been helping Misty with her exam preparation all Sunday, so he must have mistaken me for someone else. I was impressed by the pickup line, though. But how could he know my name? We had never talked before. Multiple questions rushed through me in split seconds.

Exam season was starting in less than a week, almost everyone in campus was hitting the books. Except for me. Then there was a fellow runner, who knew my name. We kept dashing rapidly across the schoolyard as I frowned. 

"In the library", Eric continued. "I was sitting behind you two when you helped your friend with that harmonic motion. I'm guilty for eavesdropping, but I can't help a physics girl". 

Smart boy, I thought. Clarification when needed. He called my tutoring a performance. Although I regarded teaching a performance, it was quite uncommon among other folks.

"I thought she called you Summer, so …".

"Errrh, yes. I am Summer. Nice to meet you too. But to be clear, and disappointing to you, I am not a Physics girl" - I confirmed my name and teased him a little. He grinned at me, then silence followed.

It was hard for me to be talkative. I was not shy and definitely not an introvert. But I was never comfortable around new people. Strangers were like closed book, with only cursory impressions. Talking to them felt like writing reviews for a book I'd never read, or a movie I'd never saw. I felt like I always have to be wary talking to new people. It was exhausting.

But this boy was charming. I stole a look at him.

He stood a little bit taller than I was. About 1.65, I estimated. He ran tall and strong, an experienced runner. He was quite lean with toned legs and calves. I took some time to take in his butts in between his steady strides.

I assumed he was a science major student due to his nerdy TV show reference. I was very much hooked on intelligent people. I found it attractive watching a boy attentively talked about his passion or understandings.

Athletic and intelligent. A rare mix. Fascinating.

## Chapter 2 - Sisters
It was almost eight on a bright Sunday morning. Sunny, warm and a bit damp. 
Summer is nowhere to be found. I tried ringing her up, but the uplifting and quite catchy tune of 'Beautiful Now' echoed about within the property. She must be out on her run. It was a typical weekend, really.

I woke up early, but never as early as she did. On Sundays, she liked to go for a long run while I headed to the kitchen to prepare us breakfast. On her running days, I always made two and a half servings. One for me, the rest, of course, was devoured by her. It seemed that putting one feet in front of another repeatedly for an hour spiked up her appetite.

"Take your shower quickly, the spaghetti is almost ready! Oh and by the way, can you help me study for Physics? The exam is by the end of next week." - I asked as soon as she entered the door. Her face was blushing with a hue of pink due to the heat regardless of a black sport cap she was wearing which would cast a shadow only shy of touching her lips during this time of day.

Summer was in her favorite sportswear which was an orange top and black leggings. She was always more active than I was.  Her lips were naturally red, full of life. She was with short orangish brown hair. It curls lightly and grew just past the shoulder. She was slim and fit as one would expect from a sporty girl.

"Sure, I'm starving"- She replied hurriedly and trotted into the shower. "Let's go to the library later, I have to look up some books on Algorithm", her voice echoed from our small bathroom at the end of the property.

It was almost magical that she got home never too late for my breakfast. Every Sunday I would experiment with a different dish, which takes up various amount to cook. But regardless of what I made, she was always back right after it was well-cooked.

Summer helped me with the dishes afterwards before we changed up and got going. We lived off campus, but not very far from it. So we walked there. Summer was dressed in a white T-shirt with touches of pale green running along the scoop necklines and along the armholes. She put herself comfortably to walk in a creamy-colored short, which was not too short. I, on the other hand, was clothed in a zebra stripe jersey and long jeans in dark blue. 

Side by side we were of comparable height, but I always fell short of her strides. They were quick and strong. I was a bit short of being called chubby. I used to bear a bit more weight. But ever since I moved in with her, she helped me a lot with eating better and moving more often. I joined in her run once in some while. It was exhausting. I was not passionate in running, although I knew that more activity would help me shred some kilograms and improve my cardiovascular condition. I was not sick, but my health could definitely improve.

We arrived at the library at last. Summer focused first on her problem with Algorithm while I revised theory for my General Physics course. She was in Computer Science, a field dominated mostly by male students. Also a field that I would never set foot near. Computers were too daunting for me.
Every time there was something wrong with my Windows, I would freak out. Summer, on the other hand, sat calmly there, flipping through page after page on Google search results and eventually set things straight for me. While she said she was always envy of my cooking and drawing, I was envied of her confidence, activeness, and calmness.
