# La Vie En Rose - My Life in Pink.

## Sweet

Bright sunshine, light breeze, hot and damp climate — typical Sunday morning. 
I was sitting alone in a local coffee shop, slowly slurping down sips of the bitter beverage.

Loud chatter, tables beside.
 Rumbling engines, people commuting.
 Distance bargaining, a crowded local market from afar. 
The sound of Life, vivid and beautiful.

I was having it with a tiny touch of condensed milk, a signature mixture in my home country. 
Tastes sweet.
 But not as sweet as what I have in front of me.
I have always loved to dive in interesting reads on Sunday mornings.
 There are plenty of time to indulge myself in the abundance of stories, ideas, and information.
 I ran into one particular book a few days ago. The encounter was a surprise, I did not intend to shop for book that day.

Earlier that day, in the morning to be exact, I finished my first ever 5-kilometer run.
I had started running for nearly a month, and had promised myself a new pair of shoes when I could run for five kilometers. 
That evening, I went for the shoes.

I picked up a Papparoti on the way in the shopping mall.
A sweetened coffee-flavored bun, hot and tender. 
Right then, I had plenty of time to spare and out of habit, I visited the bookstore. 
Locating on the top floor of the mall, this bookstore was humble, around ten-by-ten meter squared as most. 
After lurking through tens of other books, this one caught my undivided attention.

*“Blood, Sweat, and Pixels”*, it reads.

## Short One

It is quite a short one. 
On the front cover: **“The triumphant, turbulent stories behind how video games are made”** in uppercase, next to its title, drawn in an 3D animated fashion.
There are also drawings of people, probably working on some software project.
It suits the book.

The book contains ten chapters, depicting daunting process in the development of popular game franchises.
To publish a video game, it takes tremendous effort and a great amount of resources — both human, time, and financial.
A few fundamental aspects of games are the gameplay, the graphics, the stories, and of course, the one thing that binds them all together: programming.
Each of those aspect serves as a tiny cog in a complex machinery.

As someone who has been involved in the development of software, many snippets within the books satisfy me.
Funny anecdote, technical challenges, wise retrospections.
It lights my darkest days like heavy rain during droughts.

The books is relatively short, but fully enjoyable.
The author shows that **“the creative and technical logistics that go into building today’s hottest games can be more fraught with challenges and complex than the games themselves, often seeming like an endless maze or bottomless abyss”** — Quoting the beginning of the review on the back cover of the book.
The author added various annotation as footnotes to give explanation to technical terms and events going on at that time, which aids the reader to have a clearer context of the bestselling games in the making.

I sat there. Enjoying bits and pieces of this delicious treat. By myself.

It feels refreshing to spend quality time alone, immersing all the attention to lines and lines of text in front of me. Solitude, I thought, is a bliss.

## Solitude
I cannot deny the importance of companionship.
It is proven to be beneficial and vital to one’s healthy existence.
However, when it comes to things that count, I prefer solitude.
I would not call myself reclusive, but I have always enjoyed time spent alone.
Keeping distance from other people calms me and help me concentrate more easily.

Daily, weekly, and monthly goals are more attainable when you seek time to pursue it alone.
Reading, writing, running,… I am more likely to complete what I set out to do when I do it alone.
The logistics of gathering people to participate an activity together present an undeniable overhead.

First, you must find the most agreeable timeframe that most, if not all, participants can attend to.
Bear in mind that this most agreeable time is not always (if ever) your best personal time.
Right then you go in to the battle half-heartedly.
The question of WHEN is one of the most important to answer, when it comes to getting things done.
Finding the best time for you is the simplest and most effective support to build the bridge to your dreams.
Practicing alone is the only guaranteed measure to ensure that you do meaningful tasks in the best possible time within a short 24-hour day.

Second, your performance is somewhat limited by the crowd you put yourself into.
This point depends much upon the nature of activity you attend to.
For instance, reading and writing alone or with companion does not seem to change that much.
However, learning new knowledge or training for new skillsets can be greatly affected by other people.
Slowing yourself down to a pace that is comfortable for your running partners may stall your progress because you are constantly completing easy training sessions, which does not add much value to your progression.

Third, you may pick up some bad habits or negative impact. If you spend time with other people, there is an increased chance that you will pick up on some of their bad habits.
I am fond of short and concise sessions where I stop when all the productive work is done.
My friend, on the other hand takes more and longer break during our run sessions together (Sorry if you read this! I am not judging you, I am simply offering an observation) — to me this is a negative impact (maybe not for other)…

However, spending time in social settings is not inherently detrimental. Occasionally, it would benefit you.

## Companionship 

As I have mentioned, companionship is essential.
It affects my confidence positively when I start reaching out to other people, having conversations, spending time on mutual hobbies, ….

The tricky thing about WHEN, is you never know for sure. Therefore, finding the most agreeable time amongst the peers and experiment with different timeframes can help you discover the best possible time to work on your goals.
I used to run on a treadmill after work.
I thought that was the sensible time for me to practice.
However, a friend convinced me to run outside in the morning.
After one go, I switched to running in the morning almost exclusively.
It helps me start the day more alert and awake.
It also helps me lower caffeine consumption (If I was not running in the morning, I would sit down, enjoy a cup of coffee, and read).
By modifying the morning routine, it affects my evening routine as well.
As I am allowed less time to read in the morning, I naturally shift my reading time to after work.
This reduces the amount of time I play games.
After a reading session, I am more likely to write and since I am more available to writing late into my day, it is more certain that I will actually write.

About performance and habits, it is always a two-way street.
I am a quite silently competitive type of person.
Therefore putting myself in a group of more advanced peers help push me further.
I could not have pursued this new hobby if it weren’t for companionship from my lovely friend, who encourages me to change and improve my quality of life (Thank you!).
